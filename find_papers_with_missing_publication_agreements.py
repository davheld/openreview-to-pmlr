    Congratulations again on getting your submission (number {submission_info['number']}) titled "{submission_info['title']}" accepted to CoRL 2024!

    We are pleased to inform you that your paper has been selected for a **poster** presentation during one of the poster sessions. Each poster will also be given a one-minute spotlight talk to attract the audience to come to your poster in the poster session. Spotlight presentations should be given in person. To facilitate rapid back-to-back presentations, authors will provide a 1-minute video which will play muted while they speak. Additional details on poster format and spotlight requirements will be provided on the CoRL 2024 website in the coming weeks.

    Best,
